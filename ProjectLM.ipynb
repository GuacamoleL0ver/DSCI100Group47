    "Tennis is a sport that is played using a racket and a rubber ball. It can be played with either one or two players on each team, and only 2 teams play at a time. The objective of the game is to pass the ball over the net in such a way so that the opponent is unable to return the ball.[1] For every time the opponent misses the ball, the team earns points. The first team to reach the specified number of points wins a game, and after winning 6 games, the team is said to have won a \"set\". The first team to win 3 sets wins the match. Every year a new season starts. Throughout the seasons, players travel around the world to attend different tournaments. For each winning match, these players earn points that are used to rank them. Therefore, each player gets a rank corresponding to the number of wins. Throughout tennis history, there have been great battles between veterans to attain the top spot and become the best tennis player of all time.[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "In our data analysis, we aim to answer the following question: “What relationship does a player’s current ranking, number of seasons played, and prize money have on a player’s best ranking?” We will be using the “Player Stats for Top 500 Players” dataset which includes statistical information about the top 500 tennis players in the world.[3] Specifically, we will focus on the following variables: “Age, Prize Money, Seasons, Current Rank, and Best Rank”. We will use knn regression to do this analysis."

    "\n",
    "- We see clear relationships from our data analysis. As the prize money increases, the best rank decreases, indicating that these players are ranked higher. This was expected because top players earn more prize money from winning games. [4]\n",
    "\n",
    "- As the seasons played increase, the best rank decreases, indicating that these players are at a higher rank. This was expected because players gain vital experience in the previous seasons and to improve themselves, which is the key role in getting better and therefore ranking higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As current rank increases, their best rank also increases. This means that if a player's current rank is lower than their best rank, it may indicate that the player's performance has been declining. Whereas if their current rank is equal to their best rank, it may indicate improvement. \n",
    "\n",
    "- These findings could help the Sport industry select potential athletes and predict their success. Sport universities could use seasons played, prize money, and current rank to determine which athletes they would like to admit in competitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using only Seasons, Prize Money and Current Rank as predictors for athlete rank is not very accurate because ranks can be influenced by many other factors which are not present in this dataset. For example, weather on the game day, psychological quality of athletes, brands of shoes and sportswear could be potential factors for athlete grades. The physical trait also matters to a great extent of their performance and rank. Future questions could focus on addressing these problems by exploring other variables that have relationships with best rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "- These plots also show that there are a few outliers where people start off very well, and even with a very few seasons, acquire a good rank. These outliers could have affected our results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A root mean square error of 18.1066 is not too big. However, as the data set has 500 players involved, a few errors could have occured in the analysis. An R squared value of 0.84 means that most of the data points were included in our analysis, which is good because having more data can improve our predictions.\n"
